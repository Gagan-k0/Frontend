## 1. Project-Wide Rules

### 1.1 Team Division of Labour
- **Developer 1 (Lead / User):** Sole owner of the canonical database schema, all Prisma migrations, core LMS domain logic, authentication, authorization, agreement gates, session/booking business rules, attendance scoring rules, certificate eligibility rules, payment domain rules, and data reporting.
- **Developer 2 (Infrastructure & Integration Partner):** Sole owner of Cloudinary media engineering, private object storage integration (Cloudinary for development), BullMQ worker infrastructure, Redis TCP connection, Resend email infrastructure, Zoom provider, Google Meet provider, Microsoft Graph / Outlook integration, Sentry observability, Docker DevOps, Socket.IO realtime transport, and Stripe webhook infrastructure.

### 1.2 Absolute Boundary Constraints
1. **Prisma & Database Isolation:** Developer 1 is the **ONLY** developer permitted to run `prisma migrate dev`, `prisma migrate deploy`, or edit `schema.prisma`. Developer 2 must never generate or commit database migrations.
2. **Cloudinary Isolation:** Developer 2 possesses the Cloudinary credentials and owns 100% of Cloudinary configuration, SDK setup, signed URL generation, authenticated uploads, and webhook processing. Developer 1 must **NOT** need, configure, or possess Cloudinary credentials.
3. **Database Environment Neutrality:** Development uses Neon PostgreSQL Free Tier (`DATABASE_URL` pooled, `DIRECT_URL` unpooled). The Prisma schema retains `directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")`. Application logic must remain 100% vanilla PostgreSQL and Prisma client code so it can migrate to AWS RDS in production without code edits.
4. **BullMQ Protocol:** BullMQ queues and workers **MUST** connect to Redis via TCP/RESP (using local Docker Redis 7 on `localhost:6379` in development). Upstash Redis REST API is strictly prohibited for BullMQ.
5. **Contract-First Development:** Developers must agree on all TypeScript interfaces (Shared Contracts) before starting parallel tasks. Developer 1 codes against interfaces; Developer 2 implements providers.
6. **No Prototype Preservation:** Existing prototype code in `apps/api` is treated as evidence of what is missing or broken. Legacy artifacts (`packages/database/`, `modules/mux/`, order mock tables, auto-enrolment hacks) will be purged.
7. **Development Object Storage Strategy:** Development uses Cloudinary (`CloudinaryObjectStorageProvider`) for all private files (PDFs, audio, agreements, certificates) to eliminate cloud storage provisioning costs during development. All domain logic and worker services interact exclusively with the provider-neutral `IObjectStorageProvider` abstraction. Developer 1 writes code against `IObjectStorageProvider` with zero provider coupling, while Developer 2 owns the storage provider implementation and Cloudinary credentials. No AWS/R2 credentials or cloud storage accounts are required for local development.

### 1.3 Role Terminology & Batch Scoping
- The canonical Prisma schema enforces four roles: `SUPER_ADMIN`, `ADMIN`, `MANAGER`, and `USER`.
- **`Role.MANAGER` encompasses both "Manager" and "Trainer"** from the client PDF (§1.3, lines 69–79):
  - *Cohort Trainers:* Assigned to specific batches via the `BatchTrainer` relation to conduct live sessions, grade oral assessments, and view batch-specific learner progress.
  - *Corporate Managers:* Assigned to corporate batches/companies to monitor employee progression and attendance.
- Both use `Role.MANAGER` and are strictly scoped by `BatchAccessGuard`. Neither can access unassigned batches or cross-batch data. No separate `TRAINER` role is introduced into the database enum, preserving data model simplicity while enforcing domain-level batch isolation.

- [ ] **D1-028: Manager / Trainer Batch Scoping Guard**
  Implement `BatchAccessGuard`. Restrict `Role.MANAGER` (which encompasses corporate batch managers and external trainers per client PDF §1.3) so they can only view or mutate batches, enrolments, attendance, and reports for batches explicitly assigned to them in `BatchTrainer` / manager assignment tables.
- [ ] **D1-029:** Write Vitest security tests validating RBAC boundaries, permission denial, manager batch isolation, and session revocation.

- [ ] **D1-048b: Participant Email Reconciliation & Unmatched Review Queue**
  Build reconciliation engine processing normalized participant reports from Zoom and Google Meet. Aggregate cumulative duration across multiple reconnects within the same session. Match participant emails against enroled batch learners; flag unmatched attendees for Admin/Manager review and manual linkage.
- [ ] **D1-049: Attendance Compliance Calculation**
  Implement attendance compliance calculator: verify whether learner attended required live cohort sessions against a configurable program/batch attendance threshold (configurable policy default: 80%, client example: 75%).
- [ ] **D1-050:** Implement manual attendance override endpoint (`PATCH /attendance/:id/override`) requiring mandatory `correctionReason` and logging `correctedById`.

### H. Certificate Business Logic
- [ ] **D1-051: Comprehensive Certificate Eligibility Engine**
  Implement evaluation service: a learner is `ELIGIBLE` for standard Professional Certification if and only if: (1) All 11 program steps complete, (2) All 11 step quizzes passed, (3) Final 50-question exam passed, (4) Oral assessment marked `PASSED`, (5) Configurable attendance threshold met, and (6) 1-on-1 closing call marked completed.
- [ ] **D1-051b: Corporate Participation Certificate Track**
  Implement separate eligibility logic for corporate tracks: requires only workshop attendance (bypasses 50-question exam, quizzes, closing call, and CPD tracking) and generates a corporate certificate of participation.
- [ ] **D1-052:** Implement Certificate approval workflow (`ELIGIBLE` -> `PENDING_APPROVAL` -> `APPROVED` -> `ISSUED` / `REJECTED`).
- [ ] **D1-053: Certificate Code, CPD Tracking & Public Verification API**
  Generate tamper-proof unique certificate IDs (`WBM-2026-XXXX`), record accredited CPD hours on the certificate, and build public endpoint `GET /api/certificates/verify/:code` returning verified recipient name, program name, issue date, validity state, and pre-formatted LinkedIn "Add to Profile" URL parameters (`certName`, `organizationId`, `issueYear`, `issueMonth`, `certUrl`).

### I. Payments & Billing Business Logic (Phase 7 — Deferred)
- [ ] **D1-054:** Implement Payment state machine (`PENDING`, `PAID`, `FAILED`, `REFUNDED`) and link payments to Enrolment activation.
- [ ] **D1-055:** Implement coupon calculation engine (percentage discounts, fixed amounts, expiry dates, batch limits, usage caps).
- [ ] **D1-056:** Implement refund rules: revoke enrolment access on refund and issue cancellation invoice record.

### J. Chat Domain Logic (Phase 6 — Deferred)
- [ ] **D1-057:** Implement Conversation and Message database services (`OPEN`, `ASSIGNED`, `RESOLVED`, `REOPENED`).
- [ ] **D1-058:** Implement chat routing rules: route learner inquiries to assigned batch trainers/managers; prevent unsolicited cross-learner direct messaging.

### K. Reporting & Analytics Queries
- [ ] **D1-059:** Author optimized Prisma queries for batch attendance distributions, compliance percentages, and absent rates.
- [ ] **D1-060:** Build learner progress drop-off analytics identifying bottlenecks across program steps.

## 5. Cloudinary Ownership & Security Specification

### 5.1 Strict Ownership Model
Developer 2 is the **sole custodian** of Cloudinary.
- Developer 2 configures the Cloudinary account, sets up the cloud name and API credentials, and provides the NestJS integration.
- Developer 1 **must never** touch Cloudinary credentials, config files, or SDK calls. Developer 1 only receives and returns signed URLs generated by Developer 2's `IMediaProvider`.

### 5.2 Security Architecture & PDF Compliance
The Client PDF Content Protection requirement (§3.2, lines 405-419) mandates that video content must be strictly protected against unauthorized distribution.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   CLOUDINARY SECURITY PIPELINE               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  1. UPLOAD TIME
     • Assets uploaded strictly with: `type: 'authenticated'`
     • Delivery type: `authenticated` (blocks all unsigned public requests)
     • Stored in secure folder hierarchy: `/courses/{programId}/`
                               │
                               ▼
  2. URL GENERATION (ON-THE-FLY)
     • Developer 1 validates learner enrolment and unlocked step
     • Developer 2's `CloudinaryMediaProvider` signs the delivery URL:
       - `sign_url: true`
       - Short expiry: `expires_at = now() + 300` (5 minutes)
       - Server-Side Static Watermark transformation (fixed coordinates per URL):
         `l_text:Arial_24_bold:${encodeURIComponent(learnerEmail)}/co_rgb:ffffff,o_30/fl_layer_apply,g_south_east,x_20,y_20`
                               │
                               ▼
  3. DELIVERY GATEWAY
     • Strict Referrer Enforcement: "Allowed strict referral domains"
       configured in Cloudinary settings (`whatboutme.com`)
     • Any request from unauthorized origins or expired links -> 403 Forbidden
                               │
                               ▼
  4. CLIENT-SIDE DETERRENCE (FRONTEND TEAM)
     • Custom video player wrapper (no right-click, no native download)
     • Moving / floating watermark overlay periodically moving coordinates across the player canvas
```

### 5.3 Explicit Security Limitations & Watermark Architecture
- **No DRM Claim:** Cloudinary does **NOT** provide digital rights management (Widevine/FairPlay/PlayReady). Cloudinary cannot prevent OS-level screen capture or HDMI capture cards.
- **Three-Tier Watermark Strategy:**
  1. *Server-Side Static Watermark (Cloudinary — Developer 2):* Cloudinary embeds a static text overlay (learner email/ID) at fixed coordinates into the signed streaming manifest URL. This provides server-side forensic traceability without costly video re-encoding.
  2. *Client-Side Moving Watermark (Custom Player — Frontend Team):* The frontend video player renders an animated text watermark that continuously shifts position across the video canvas over time.
  3. *Server-Side Animated Watermarking (Deferred Spike U1):* True frame-by-frame server-side moving watermarking (burning moving text via FFmpeg) is a separate deferred technical spike and is NOT part of the current implementation commitment.
- **Deterrence Model:** The security model implemented is **deterrence and traceability**:
  1. Direct file download is blocked.
  2. Shared URLs expire after 5 minutes.
  3. Video embed links do not load outside `whatboutme.com`.
  4. Static and client-moving watermarks trace any illicit screen recordings back to the specific learner account.

## 7. Database / Migration Ownership

### 7.1 The Non-Negotiable Law
> **Developer 1 is the sole database administrator.**
> Developer 2 must **never** execute `prisma migrate dev`, edit `schema.prisma`, or push migrations.

### 7.2 Schema Modification Protocol (When Dev 2 Needs Schema Changes)
If Developer 2 requires a database change (e.g., adding `StripeWebhookEvent`, adding fields to `DeviceSession`):
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 SCHEMA MODIFICATION WORKFLOW                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  Step 1: Developer 2 creates an RFC / Issue
          - Explains the technical requirement
          - Proposes exact fields, relations, and nullability
                               │
                               ▼
  Step 2: Developer 1 reviews the proposal
          - Checks naming conventions, indexes, constraints
          - Validates against business rules and data models
                               │
                               ▼
  Step 3: Developer 1 modifies `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`
          - Executes `prisma migrate dev --name <migration_name>`
          - Validates generated SQL migration file
                               │
                               ▼
  Step 4: Developer 1 commits and pushes
          - Pushes migration file and updated Prisma schema to Git
                               │
                               ▼
  Step 5: Developer 2 pulls Git updates
          - Developer 2 runs `npx prisma generate` locally
          - Developer 2 consumes newly updated TypeScript types
```

16. Microsoft Graph client, Azure AD auth, Outlook calendar event CRUD, and free/busy queries (`getBusySlots()`).
17. PDF certificate generation worker using `pdf-lib` (rendering certificate code, recipient, date, QR code, CPD hours).
18. Multi-stage production `Dockerfile` and Docker Compose environment.

## 13. What Must NOT Be Implemented Yet

1. **Stripe Payments (DEFERRED):** No payment gateway code, checkout sessions, or live webhooks until Phase 7.
2. **Mock Payment Tables:** Do not create or retain prototype `Order` or mock payment tables.
3. **Nodemailer:** Do not install or use Nodemailer; transactional email must use Resend and React Email.
4. **Mux Video:** Mux is officially rejected and must be completely removed (`@mux/mux-node` and `modules/mux`).
5. **LinkedIn / Social Login:** The client PDF does not require social login; do not add OAuth social login.
6. **Upstash REST for BullMQ:** BullMQ must never connect via Upstash HTTP/REST; it strictly requires Redis TCP/RESP.
7. **Premature AWS Cloud Provisioning:** Do not create live AWS RDS or ECS resources during local dev. Development uses Neon, Docker Redis, and Cloudinary for all media/storage; no cloud storage accounts are required.
8. **Frontend Code:** Backend developers must not modify frontend packages or UI components.
